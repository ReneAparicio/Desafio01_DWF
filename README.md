The bookApi folder contains the main program which runs by default on port 9090. The program in the Challenge01 folder
uses port 8080 and contains the final version of the program with its respective validations.

The program works as follows: you add a book, then it lists all the books you have added, you can also search 
for a book by its title and delete a book by its ID.

All the functionalities were validated through tests performed in Postman.
