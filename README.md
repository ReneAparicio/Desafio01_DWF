The bookApi folder contains the main program which runs by default on port 9090. The program in the Desafio01 folder
uses port 8080 and contains the final version of the program with its respective validations.

The program is a basic crud using postman commands and works as follows: a book is added, then all the books that have
been added are listed, you can also search for a book by its title and delete a book by its ID.

All functionalities were validated by testing in Postman.
